Hello and welcome to my corner of the internet! This is the inaugural post for **tommos.co.uk**, and I'm excited to share this journey with you.

## Why Start a Blog?

I've been wanting to create a space where I can:

- Document my learning experiences
- Share solutions to problems I've encountered
- Explore new technologies and frameworks
- Connect with other developers and tech enthusiasts

## What's Under the Hood

This blog is powered by [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), a blazingly fast static site generator. Here's why I chose it:

> "Hugo is one of the most popular open-source static site generators. With its amazing speed and flexibility, Hugo makes building websites fun again." - Hugo Documentation

Some key features I'm using:

- **Fast build times** - Hugo can build thousands of pages in seconds
- **Markdown support** - Write content in simple, readable Markdown
- **Theme customization** - Using the PaperMod theme for a clean, modern look
- **Syntax highlighting** - Perfect for sharing code snippets

## Technical Setup

Here's a quick example of how to set up a Hugo project:

```bash
# Install Hugo
brew install hugo

# Create new site
hugo new site my-blog

# Add a theme
git submodule add https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod.git themes/PaperMod

# Create a new post
hugo new posts/my-first-post.md

# Run development server
hugo server -D
```

Pretty straightforward, right?

## What's Next?

I'm planning to write about:

1. Web development tips and tricks
2. DevOps and deployment strategies
3. Programming languages I'm learning
4. Interesting projects and experiments
5. Book reviews and learning resources
