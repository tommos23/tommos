# Legacy Site Files

This directory contains the original "Coming Soon" landing page that was used before the Hugo blog was implemented.

## Contents

- `index.html` - Simple coming soon page
- `styles.css` - CSS styling for the landing page

## Historical Context

These files represent the initial placeholder site for tommos.co.uk before the full blog implementation using Hugo and the PaperMod theme.

## Status

These files are kept for historical reference and are not used in the current Hugo site. The current site is built from the `content/` directory and served from the `public/` directory after Hugo builds.

## Removal Consideration

If there's no need to preserve this history, this directory can be safely removed as it's not referenced by the current Hugo site.
